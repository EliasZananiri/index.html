<div id ="grad1" >Diary And Chaplet With 

Prayer:<br>
1. Make the Sign of the Cross
In the name of the Father, and of the Son, 

and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.

2. Optional Opening Prayers
St. Faustina’s Prayer for Sinners
O Jesus, eternal Truth, our Life, I call upon 

You and I beg Your mercy for poor sinners. O 

sweetest Heart of my Lord, full of pity and 

unfathomable mercy, I plead with You for poor 

sinners. O Most Sacred Heart, Fount of Mercy 

from which gush forth rays of inconceivable 

graces upon the entire human race, I beg of 

You light for poor sinners. O Jesus, be 

mindful of Your own bitter Passion and do not 

permit the loss of souls redeemed at so dear 

a price of Your most precious Blood. O Jesus, 

when I consider the great price of Your 

Blood, I rejoice at its immensity, for one 

drop alone would have been enough for the 

salvation of all sinners. Although sin is an 

abyss of wickedness and ingratitude, the 

price paid for us can never be equalled. 

Therefore, let every soul trust in the 

Passion of the Lord, and place its hope in 

His mercy. God will not deny His mercy to 

anyone. Heaven and earth may change, but 

God's mercy will never be exhausted. Oh, what 

immense joy burns in my heart when I 

contemplate Your incomprehensible goodness, O 

Jesus! I desire to bring all sinners to Your 

feet that they may glorify Your mercy 

throughout endless ages (Diary of Saint Maria 

Faustina Kowalska, 72).

You expired, Jesus, but the source of life 

gushed forth for souls, and the ocean of 

mercy opened up for the whole world. O Fount 

of Life, unfathomable Divine Mercy, envelop 

the whole world and empty Yourself out upon 

us.

(Repeat three times)
O Blood and Water, which gushed forth from 

the Heart of Jesus as a fount of mercy for 

us, I trust in You!

3. Our Father
Our Father, Who art in Heaven, hallowed be 

Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done 

on earth as it is in Heaven. Give us this day 

our daily bread; and forgive us our 

trespasses, as we forgive those who trespass 

against us; and lead us not into temptation, 

but deliver us from evil, Amen.

4. Hail Mary
Hail Mary, full of grace. The Lord is with 

thee. Blessed art thou amongst women, and 

blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy 

Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners, now 

and at the hour of our death, Amen.

5. The Apostles’ Creed
I believe in God, the Father almighty, 

Creator of Heaven and earth, and in Jesus 

Christ, His only Son, our Lord, who was 

conceived by the Holy Spirit, born of the 

Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius Pilate, 

was crucified, died and was buried; He 

descended into hell; on the third day He rose 

again from the dead; He ascended into Heaven, 

and is seated at the right hand of God the 

Father almighty; from there He will come to 

judge the living and the dead. I believe in 

the Holy Spirit, the holy Catholic Church, 

the Communion of Saints, the forgiveness of 

sins, the Resurrection of the body, and life 

everlasting. Amen.

6. The Eternal Father
Eternal Father, I offer You the Body and 

Blood, Soul and Divinity of Your Dearly 

Beloved Son, Our Lord, Jesus Christ, in 

atonement for our sins and those of the whole 

world.

7. On the 10 Small Beads of Each Decade
For the sake of His sorrowful Passion, have 

mercy on us and on the whole world.

8. Repeat for the remaining decades
Saying the "Eternal Father" (6) on the "Our 

Father" bead and then 10 "For the sake of His 

sorrowful Passion" (7) on the following "Hail 

Mary" beads.

9. Conclude with Holy God (Repeat three 

times)
Holy God, Holy Mighty One, Holy Immortal One, 

have mercy on us and on the whole world.

10. Optional Closing Prayers
Eternal God, in Whom mercy is endless and the 

treasury of compassion — inexhaustible, look 

kindly upon us and increase Your mercy in us, 

that in difficult moments we might not 

despair nor become despondent, but with great 

confidence submit ourselves to Your holy 

will, which is Love and Mercy itself.

O Greatly Merciful God, Infinite Goodness, 

today all mankind calls out from the abyss of 

its misery to Your mercy — to Your 

compassion, O God; and it is with its mighty 

voice of misery that it cries out. Gracious 

God, do not reject the prayer of this earth's 

exiles! O Lord, Goodness beyond our 

understanding, Who are acquainted with our 

misery through and through, and know that by 

our own power we cannot ascend to You, we 

implore You: anticipate us with Your grace 

and keep on increasing Your mercy in us, that 

we may faithfully do Your holy will all 

through our life and at death's hour. Let the 

omnipotence of Your mercy shield us from the 

darts of our salvation’s enemies, that we may 

with confidence, as Your children, await Your 

[Son’s] final coming — that day known to You 

alone. And we expect to obtain everything 

promised us by Jesus in spite of all our 

wretchedness. For Jesus is our Hope: through 

His merciful Heart, as through an open gate, 

we pass through to Heaven (Diary, 1570).

<h4><u>Promises Of The Chaplet:</u></h4>
<p>Promises of the Chaplet for all Things
I desire to grant unimaginable graces to 

those souls who trust in My mercy.  (687)

My daughter, encourage souls to say the 

chaplet which I have given to you.  It 

pleases Me to grant everything they ask of Me 

by saying the chaplet.  (1541)

Promises of the Chaplet to Appease God’s 

Anger
This prayer will serve to appease My wrath.  

(476)

When this chaplet is said by the bedside of a 

dying person, God’s anger is placated.  (811)

This chaplet mitigates God’s anger, as He 

Himself told me.  (1036)

It [the chaplet] appeases the anger of God.  

(1565)

Promises of the Chaplet for Sinners
Priests will recommend it to sinners as their 

last hope of salvation.  Even if there were a 

sinner most hardened, if he were to recite 

this chaplet only once, he would receive 

grace from My infinite mercy.  (687)

When hardened sinners say it, I will fill 

their souls with peace, and the hour of their 

death will be a happy one.  (1541)

Promises of the Chaplet for Storms
Today I was awakened by a great storm.  The 

wind was raging, and it was raining in 

torrents, thunderbolts striking again and 

again.  I began to pray that the storm would 

do no harm, when I heard the words:  Say the 

chaplet I have taught you, and the storm will 

cease.  I began immediately to say the 

chaplet and hadn’t even finished it when the 

storm suddenly ceased, and I heard the words: 

 Through the chaplet you will obtain 

everything, if what you ask for is compatible 

with My will.  (1731)

When a great storm was approaching, I began 

to say the chaplet.  Suddenly I heard the 

voice of an angel:  “I cannot approach in 

this storm, because the light which comes 

from her mouth drives back both me and the 

storm.”  Such was the angel’s complaint to 

God.  I then recognized how much havoc he was 

to have made through this storm; but I also 

recognized that this prayer was pleasing to 

God, and that this chaplet was most powerful. 

 (1791)

Promises of the Chaplet for the Faithful
The souls that say this chaplet will be 

embraced by My mercy during their lifetime 

and especially at the hour of their death.  

(754)

While I was saying the chaplet, I heard a 

voice which said, Oh, what great graces I 

will grant to souls who say this chaplet; the 

very depths of My tender mercy are stirred 

for the sake of those who say the chaplet.  O 

what a great multitude of souls I see!  They 

worshiped the Divine Mercy and will be 

singing the hymn of praise for all eternity.  

(848)

Promises of the Chaplet for the Dying
I realize more and more how much every soul 

needs God’s mercy throughout life and 

particularly at the hour of death.  This 

chaplet mitigates God’s anger, as He Himself 

told me.  (1036)

At the hour of their death, I defend as My 

own glory every soul that will say this 

chaplet; or when others say it for a dying 

person, the pardon is the same.  When this 

chaplet is said by the bedside of a dying 

person, God’s anger is placated, unfathomable 

mercy envelops the soul, and the very depths 

of My tender mercy are moved for the sake of 

the sorrowful Passion of My Son.  (811)

Saint Faustina’s Stories of Praying the 

Chaplet for the Dying
The stories from the Diary of St. Faustina 

that follow below clearly demonstrate the 

extremely holy relationship that exists 

between God and man and death.  They show how 

the recitation of the chaplet comes to the 

aid of souls at their last moments, 

especially souls in distress.  Millions 

worldwide have followed St. Faustina’s 

example of praying at the bedside of someone, 

most often a loved one, during their last 

moments and are now sharing stories about 

their experiences.  Stories that are, maybe 

not so surprising, strikingly similar to 

these included here.  Let us also follow the 

path of St. Faustina and do as the Lord 

commands and “pray as much as we can for the 

dying.”  What a great gift our humble prayers 

may obtain for them:

Pray as much as you can for the dying.  By 

your entreaties, obtain for them trust in My 

mercy, because they have most need of trust, 

and have it the least.  Be assured that the 

grace of eternal salvation for certain souls 

in their final moment depends on your prayer. 

 (1777)

The First Soul to Benefit of the Lord’s 

Promise
During the night, I was suddenly awakened and 

knew that some soul was asking me for prayer, 

and that it was in much need of prayer.  

Briefly, but with all my soul, I asked the 

Lord for grace for her.  (809)

The following afternoon, when I entered the 

ward, I saw someone dying, and learned that 

the agony had started during the night.  When 

I verified it – it had been at the time when 

I had been asked for prayer.  And just then, 

I heard a voice in my soul:  Say the chaplet 

which I taught you.  I ran to fetch my rosary 

and knelt down by the dying person and, with 

all the ardor of my soul, I began to say the 

chaplet.  Suddenly the dying person opened 

her eyes and looked at me; I had not managed 

to finish the entire chaplet when she died, 

with extraordinary peace.  I fervently asked 

the Lord to fulfill the promise He had given 

me for the recitation of the chaplet.  The 

Lord gave me to know that the soul had been 

granted the grace He had promised me.  That 

was the first soul to receive the benefit of 

the Lord’s promise.  I could feel the power 

of mercy envelop that soul.  (810)

A Suffering Young Man Dies Peacefully
This evening, a certain young man was dying; 

he was suffering terribly.  For his 

intention, I began to say the chaplet which 

the Lord had taught me.  I said it all, but 

the agony continued. I wanted to start the 

Litany of the Saints, but suddenly I heard 

the words, Say the chaplet.  I understood 

that the soul needed the special help of 

prayers and great mercy.  And so I locked 

myself in my room and fell prostrate before 

God and begged for mercy upon that soul.  

Then I felt the great majesty of God and His 

great justice.  I trembled with fear, but did 

not stop begging the Lord’s mercy for that 

soul.  Then I took the cross off my breast, 

the crucifix I had received when making my 

vows, and I put it on the chest of the dying 

man and said to the Lord, “Jesus, look on 

this soul with the same love with which You 

looked on my holocaust on the day of my 

perpetual vows, and by the power of the 

promise which You made to me in respect to 

the dying and those who would invoke Your 

mercy on them, [grant this man the grace of a 

happy death].”  His suffering then ceased, 

and he died peacefully.  Oh, how much we 

should pray for the dying!  Let us take 

advantage of mercy while there is still time 

for mercy.   (1035)

The Powers of Darkness Fled in a Panic
When I entered the chapel for a moment, the 

Lord said to me, My daughter, help Me to save 

a certain dying sinner.  Say the chaplet that 

I have taught you for him.  When I began to 

say the chaplet, I saw the man dying in the 

midst of terrible torment and struggle.  His 

Guardian Angel was defending him, but he was, 

as it were, powerless against the enormity of 

the soul’s misery.  A multitude of devils was 

waiting for the soul. But while I was saying 

the chaplet, I saw Jesus just as He is 

depicted in the image.  The rays which issued 

from Jesus’ Heart enveloped the sick man, and 

the powers of darkness fled in panic.  The 

sick man peacefully breathed his last.  When 

I came to myself, I understood how very 

important the chaplet was for the dying.  It 

appeases the anger of God.  (1565)

Help for a Soul Already in Despair
Today, the Lord came to me and said, My 

daughter, help Me to save souls. You will go 

to a dying sinner, and you will continue to 

recite the chaplet, and in this way you will 

obtain for him trust in My mercy, for he is 

already in despair.  (1797)

Suddenly, I found myself in a strange cottage 

where an elderly man was dying amidst great 

torments.  All about the bed was a multitude 

of demons and the family, who were crying.  

When I began to pray, the spirits of darkness 

fled, with hissing and threats directed at 

me.  The soul became calm and, filled with 

trust, rested in the Lord.  At the same 

moment, I found myself again in my own room.  

How this happens…  I do not know.  (1798)</p>
